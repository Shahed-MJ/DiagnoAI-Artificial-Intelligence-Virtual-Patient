# DiagnoAI – Artificial Intelligence Virtual Patient System

## Overview
DiagnoAI is an Artificial Intelligence–powered virtual patient system developed as a graduation project.
The platform is designed to support medical students by simulating realistic patient interactions and
evaluating diagnostic reasoning through automated workflows.

The system allows users to conduct virtual patient interviews, analyze symptoms, and receive structured
feedback on diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Medical students often face limited access to real clinical cases and consistent feedback during
diagnostic training. Traditional learning methods lack interactive, scalable, and objective evaluation
mechanisms for assessing clinical reasoning skills.

## Proposed Solution
DiagnoAI addresses this challenge by providing a virtual patient environment powered by Artificial
Intelligence. The system simulates patient responses, guides the diagnostic process, and evaluates
user decisions using structured assessment logic.

## System Architecture
The platform follows a modular architecture:

- **Backend:** Handles application logic, patient simulation, diagnostic workflows, and evaluation
- **Frontend:** Provides an interactive web interface for user–patient interaction
- **Data Layer:** Stores structured medical cases, symptoms, and evaluation criteria

## Key Features
- Artificial Intelligence–driven virtual patient simulations
- Natural language interaction with simulated patients
- Structured diagnostic workflows and evaluation criteria
- Automated scoring and feedback generation
- Case-based assessment of diagnostic accuracy and clinical reasoning

## Novelty and Contribution
- Application of large language models for realistic clinical simulations
- Automated and consistent diagnostic evaluation without manual grading
- Educational focus tailored for medical training environments
- Scalable case-based assessment framework

## Achievements
- Reduced manual diagnostic evaluation time by approximately 70%
- Improved consistency in diagnostic assessment through automated workflows
- Enabled scalable virtual case simulations for medical education
